<p style="font-size:25px;">In view of the fact that the traditional way of flower shop information management is based on manual processing of paper media such as text and forms, manual calculations are often used to count and verify the order of flowers. Data processing is tedious and error-prone. Therefore, this design uses ASP technology and IIS technology, combined with database SQL Server , using Visual Studio  development tools, designed and implemented a dynamic intelligent flower shop management system based on MIS. The system makes the flower sales management work standardized, systematic and procedural, avoids arbitrariness, improves the speed and accuracy of sales, and timely, accurately and effectively inquiries about and revise orders and flowers. The low operating costs of on-line flower shops, short cycle of capital turnover, and faster information updates are more conducive to market development.</p>
